When downloading the folder with all the code implemented each time from github. 
You might need to do the following steps.

Running in git-bash environment: 
    run "python3 -m venv .venv" or "py -3 -m venv .venv" or "python -m venv .venv" to get the environment folder setup. 
    (this environment doesnt change the code. Must run it everytime you download the code folder for vscode)
    run "source .venv/Scripts/activate" to run a controlled environment
    (this will not affect any python configuration on the main host)
    if it says "no module name 'django'" run the following:
        pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install django
        python manage.py runserver

Running in CMD environment:
    run ".venv\Scripts\activate" to run a controlled environment

Running in POWERSHELL:
    run ".venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1"
    if POWERSHELL disabled running scripts on the system 
        run "Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass"
        (this temporarly disables the security feature)
        if you want to disable it permnantly (wouldn't recommend)
            run "Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned"
